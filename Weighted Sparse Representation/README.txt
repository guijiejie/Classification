Description: This package includes the MATLAB code of the locality Weighted Sparse Representation based Classification (WSRC) algorithm. WSRC utilizes both data locality and linearity; it can be regarded as extensions of Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC), but the coding is local. The SPAMS package is required. It can be downloaded from
