% K-Nearest-Neighbor classifier(K-NN classifier)
%Input:
%     Train_data,Test_data are training data set and test data
%     set,respectively.(Each row is a data point)
%     Train_label,Test_label are column vectors.They are labels of training
%     data set and test data set,respectively.
%     k is the number of nearest neighbors
%     Distance_mark           :   ['Euclidean', 'L2'| 'L1' | 'Cos'] 
%     'Cos' represents Cosine distance.
%Output:
%     rate:Accuracy of K-NN classifier

%      
% %Classification problem with three classes
